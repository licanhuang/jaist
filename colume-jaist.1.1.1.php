$abstract = 'Text-to-image generation is conducted through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or transformer models. However, the current challenge lies in accurately generating images based on textual descriptions, especially in scenarios where the content and theme of the target image are ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes artificial intelligence models for thematic creativity, followed by a classification modeling of the actual painting process. The method involves converting all visual elements into quantifiable data structures before creating images. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of semantic accuracy, image reproducibility, and computational efficiency, in comparison with existing image generation algorithms.';
