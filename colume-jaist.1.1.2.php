<p style ="font-size:8px;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

In healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI) has been
changing the way doctors and health experts take care of people.
This paper will cover how AI is making major changes in the
health care system, especially with nutrition. Various machine
learning and deep learning algorithms have been developed to
extract valuable information from healthcare data which help
doctors, nutritionists, and health experts to make better
decisions and make our lifestyle healthy. This paper provides an
overview of the current state of AI applications in healthcare
with a focus on the utilization of AI-driven recommender
systems in nutrition. It will discuss the positive outcomes and
challenges that arise when AI is used in this field. This paper
addresses the challenges to develop AI recommender systems in
healthcare, providing a well-rounded perspective on the
complexities. Real-world examples and research findings are
presented to underscore the tangible and significant impact AI
recommender systems have in the field of healthcare,
particularly in nutrition. The ongoing efforts of applying AI in
nutrition lay the groundwork for a future where personalized
recommendations play a pivotal role in guiding individuals
toward healthier lifestyles.
