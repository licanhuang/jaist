$abstract = "The 'black box' phenomenon and limited 
interpretability present significant obstacles in machine 
learning and deep learning for portfolio management. 
Additionally, standard metrics for interpretability in machine 
learning often struggle to effectively elucidate model features in 
portfolio decision contexts. This research aims to address these 
challenges by introducing a methodology for generating easily 
interpretable portfolios. The approach involves using Random 
Forest feature importance analysis within multi-factor models, 
followed by clustering based on stock factors. Portfolios are 
generated using the Mean-CVaR model, and the effectiveness of 
the proposed explainable portfolios is evaluated through 
comparative analysis with two machine learning interpretability 
tools: SHAP and Permutation methods. ";
