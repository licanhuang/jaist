$abstract = 'Twitter and similar microblogging platforms have
gained popularity in Latin America, fostering communities
discussing various topics, including product experiences. As
businesses aim to understand customer preferences, sentiment
analysis and topic understanding become crucial. This paper
focuses on classifying short-text comments from product reviews
extracted from Twitter. Two semisupervised techniques, Label
Propagation and a variation of Structural Learning, are employed to improve classification performance with limited labeled
data. The challenges posed by short text and noisy data are
addressed, and experimental results are presented, showcasing
the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to traditional
supervised learning. Future directions for further improvements
are also discussed.';
